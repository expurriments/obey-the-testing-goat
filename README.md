# Test-Driven Development with Python

## Introduction

Just me learning Test-Driven Development with Python, Django, Selenium, and JavaScript. For most of the time, I am following the steps from [Test-Driven Development with Python: Obey the Testing Goat: Using Django, Selenium, and JavaScript *by Harry J. W. Percival*](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Selenium-JavaScript/dp/1491958707) book that is available on [`obeythetestinggoat.com`](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/)

I intentionally take it to the extreme and see what else I can test.

## Tests

```
$ python -m unittest discover tests
$ python manage.py tests
```

## etc
